\title{
Importance Test for Covariate(s) of Interest
}
\description{
This function tests the null hypothesis \eqn{H_0}: These covariates of interest
do not affect the response under the assumptions of the BART 
model.
}
\usage{
cov_importance_test(bart_machine, covariates = NULL, 
num_permutation_samples = 100, plot = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{bart_machine}{
  An object of class ``bart_machine''.
}
  \item{covariates}{
	A vector of names of covariates of interest to be tested for having an effect on the response. A value of NULL
	indicates an omnibus test for all covariates having an effect on the response. If the name of a covariate is a factor,
	the entire factor will be permuted. We do not recommend entering the names of factor covariate dummies.
}
  \item{num_permutation_samples}{
	The number of times to permute the covariates of interest and create a corresponding new BART model (see details).
}
  \item{plot}{
	If \code{TRUE}, this produces a histogram of the Pseudo-Rsq's / total misclassifcation error rates from
	the \code{num_permutations} BART models created with the \code{covariates} permuted. The plot also illustrates
	the observed Pseudo-Rsq's / total misclassifcation error rate from the original training data and indicates
	the test's p-value.
}
}
\details{
To test the importance of a covariate or a set of covariates of interest on the response, this function generates 
\code{num_permutations} BART models with the covariate(s) of interest permuted (differently each time). 
On each run, a measure of fit is recorded. For regression, the metric is Pseudo-Rsq; for classification, it is
total misclassification error.\cr A 
p-value can then be generated as follows. For regression, the p-value is the number of 
permutation-sampled Pseudo-Rsq's greater than the observed Pseudo-Rsq divided by 
\code{num_permutations + 1}. For classification, the p-value is the number of permutation-sampled 
total misclassification errors less than the observed total misclassification error divided by \code{num_permutations + 1}.
}
\value{
\item{permutation_samples_of_error}{A vector which records the error metric of the BART models with the covariates permuted (see details).}
\item{observed_error_estimate}{For regression, this is the Pseudo-Rsq on the original
training data set. For classification, this is the observed total misclassification error
on the original training data set.}
\item{pval}{The approximate p-value for this test (see details).
