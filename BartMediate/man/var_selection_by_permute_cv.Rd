\title{
Perform Variable Selection Using Cross-validation Procedure
}
\description{
Performs variable selection by cross-validating over the three threshold-based procedures outlined in Bleich et al. (2013) and selecting the single procedure that returns the lowest cross-validation RMSE. 
}
\usage{
var_selection_by_permute_cv(bart_machine, k_folds = 5, 
num_reps_for_avg = 5, num_permute_samples = 100, 
num_trees_for_permute = 20, alpha = 0.05, num_trees_pred_cv = 50)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{bart_machine}{
An object of class ``bartMachine''.
}
  \item{k_folds}{
Number of folds to be used in cross-validation.
}
  \item{num_reps_for_avg}{
Number of replicates to over over to for the BART model's variable inclusion proportions.
}
  \item{num_permute_samples}{
Number of permutations of the response to be made to generate the ``null'' permutation distribution.
}
  \item{num_trees_for_permute}{
Number of trees to use in the variable selection procedure. As with \cr \code{\link{investigate_var_importance}}, a small number of trees should be used to force variables to compete for entry into the model. Note that this number is used to estimate both the ``true'' and ``null'' variable inclusion proportions.
}
  \item{alpha}{
Cut-off level for the thresholds.
}
  \item{num_trees_pred_cv}{
Number of trees to use for prediction on the hold-out portion of each fold. Once variables have been selected using the training portion of each fold, a new model is built using only those variables with \code{num_trees_pred_cv} trees in the sum-of-trees model. Forecasts for the holdout sample are made using this model. A larger number of trees is recommended to exploit the full forecasting power of BART.

\value{
Returns a list with the following components:

  \item{best_method}{The name of the best variable selection procedure, as chosen via cross-validation.}
  \item{important_vars_cv}{The variables chosen by the \code{best_method} above.}
