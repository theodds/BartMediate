# BartMediate

This is a fork of the bartMachine package with details listed below,
designed for use in mediation analysis. Of course, any bugs here are my
own. For details, see: *Linero and Zhang (2021). Mediation Analysis
using Bayesian Tree Ensembles*, which will be made available on arXiv
shortly.

# Instructions

For detailed instructions on installation, see the instructions on the
[bartMachine](https://github.com/kapelner/bartMachine/) repository. This
package is not available on CRAN, and must be installed by compiling
from the source.

# Illustration

There is a simple script analyzing the `jobs` dataset from the package
`mediation` in the folder `BartMediate/inst/scripts`. We will add much
more detail/documentation/tutorials in the near future.
